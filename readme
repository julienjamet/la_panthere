This project has been made during my dev training (SEO / accessibility / performance).
 
My purpose was to improve an existing site according to these three axes.
 
The initial version of the site can be visited here :
 
https://julienjamet-lapanthere-initial-state.netlify.app
 
and the optimized version by clicking on the link located in the About section.
 
You can compare both versions by using tools like Lighthouse or Wave.
 
You can access the code of the optimized version by switching to the other branch.
